Facial Expression Recognition using Deep Learning
Facial expression recognition is a computer vision task that involves identifying the emotional state of a person based on their facial features. This project uses a deep learning model to detect and classify facial expressions in real-time video streams.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV
TensorFlow
NumPy
Installation
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-expression-recognition.git


Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the pre-trained deep learning model and Haar cascade classifier:

network-5Labels.h5
haar_cascade_face_detection.xml
Place the downloaded files in the project directory.

Usage
Run the Python script:

python facial_expression_recognition.py
The script will open a new window displaying the video stream from your webcam. It will detect faces and classify the facial expressions in real-time.

Press any key to exit the program.

Customization
You can change the number of labels and their corresponding emotional states by modifying the labels list in the script.
Adjust the detection settings (scale factor, minimum neighbors, minimum size) in the settings dictionary to improve accuracy or performance.
Credits
This project was inspired by the work of Paul van Gent, who created the Emotion Recognition with Python, OpenCV and a Face Dataset repository.
